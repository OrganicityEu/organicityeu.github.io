  <p>Welcome to the <a href="http://organicity.eu">OrganiCity</a> GitHub account. This web page will give you a comprehensive view of all the repositories made available.</p>
<h1>Organicity Experimentation as a Service Facility</h1>
<p>OrganiCity project has built an Experimentation-as-a-Service (EssS) framework that supports the co-creation and validation of a large set of smart city services and applications under real conditions in a powerful innovation ecosystem. In such ecosystem, this framework is meant to provide functionality to both advanced users/developers, as well as more "casual" end-users like citizens or even activists, decision makers or politicians (Organicitizens).<br>The idea behind this objective is that any Organicitizen, might develop and deploy its own services (e.g., a website, a web service, a desktop application or a smartphone application) that interact with the platform through the different APIs exposed by Organicity facility.</p>
<h2>High level architecture of the facility</h2>
<p>As it can be seen in the following figure, three different tiers can be distinguished within the OC facility architecture: &nbsp;
<br><strong>Figure 1. </strong>OrganiCity facility high level architecture<br>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>OC Experimentation tier.</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>OC Platform tier.</em></strong> It is represented by the OC platform and its components to manage it.</li>
<li><strong><em>OC Site tier.</em></strong> it consists of infrastructures belonging to different <strong>OC City sites</strong>, the infrastructures and resources of experimenters <strong>(OC experimenters site)</strong> and the infrastructure supporting the generation of crowdsourcing data into the platform <strong>(OC Provider Site).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that experimenters aiming to feed data into the platform should rely on the OC experimenters site.&nbsp; It exposes several methods trough the Federation API that can create, delete or update assets within the facility under the scope of the experiment. <a href="https://github.com/OrganicityEu/organicityeu.github.io/blob/master/doc/HowToPushAnAsset.md">(More info )</a></p>
<h2>Users Accounts and registration</h2>
<p>To ensure that all interactions with the facility are authenticated with valid user credentials and access rights, Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) mechanisms have been implemented. Users will be enforcer to use their own credentials to interact with the different APIs and tools. So that, to start experimenting on top of the OC facility, the experimenters are encouraged to register themselves in the platform. (See more details about this registration process)
<br>People registered in the platform will assigned with the OC user role. The OC facility managers will assign the experimenters the OC experimenter role upon the acceptation of corresponding request. To this end, you should send an email to helpdesk@organicity.eu, indicating the mail that you have been registered with.</p>
<h2>Tools and enablers for experimentation in Organicity</h2>
<p>Once the experimenters are registered in the facility, they will have access to a set of tools that will facilitate the experimentation and co-creation activities that they have planned within the experiment. Attending to their functionalities, they can be classified in three different types:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools to Manage the experiment life-cycle. </strong>To create, configure and run experiments within the OrganiCity facility, experimenters must use the Experimenter Portal, and other complementary components which will allow them to manage different experiments concurrently.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experimenter Portal</strong>: It is the user interface to be used by the experimenters in order to define the scope of the experiments and manage them during their entire life cycle. From this portal, the experimenters will get access to the set of co-creation tools offered that they can use to build their experiments, the documentation and support channels. (<a href="https://github.com/OrganicityEu/organicityeu.github.io/blob/master/doc/ExperimenterPortal.md">See further details about how to manage the experiment life cycle</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Smartphone experimentation framework</strong>: It is a complementary framework that facilitates experimenter to gather and process data from the sensors and communication interfaces of the smartphones of volunteers and use them to run experiments. <a href="https://github.com/OrganicityEu/smartphone-experimentation-service">(More)</a></li>
<li><strong>Community Management</strong> Basic functionality for interacting with the different communities of <em>Organicitizens</em> participating in each experiment. (More details)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Tools for discovering, exploring and annotating data assets. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urban Data Observatory UI</strong>. The UDO UI (UDO Manual)</li>
<li><strong>Data Annotation services.</strong> These services simplify the process of creating meaningful knowledge from urban data streams. The first phase of this tool will allow experimenters and citizens to use pre-defined tag sets for annotating existing data assets. <a href="https://github.com/OrganicityEu/organicityeu.github.io/blob/master/doc/AssetAnnotationService.md">(More details) </></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Co-creation tools.</strong> A set of innovative tools and enablers for the co-creation of urban infrastructure, knowledge and services has been developed and integrated within the EaaS facility infrastructure, extending it and facilitating experimental research for new services and innovative applications.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://organicityeu.github.io/tools/sensinact/">SensiNact</a></strong> aims at helping coders working with data streams from deployed data assets without the need to learn about the Organicity APIs. By using <strong>it, experimenters can interact with information of different data assets available in</strong> the different clusters, as well as within the scope of their experiments, and understand the data streams that they provide. The SensiNact IDE allows the creation of applications using a scripting tool (with Code Assist functionality). (More&hellip;)</li>
<li><strong> <a href="https://organicityeu.github.io/TSmarT/">(More)</a></strong></li>
<li>Toolkit for creating mobile services - Apps - without the need for extensive software training or experience. Tinkerspace builds on the idea of Component-based software engineering and Visual programming, with LEGO&trade; as an inspiration &ndash; it should be as easy to build a mobile app as to build a LEGO&trade; model (<a href="https://organicityeu.github.io/TinkerSpace/">More&hellip;</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Websocket processing library <a href="https://github.com/OrganicityEu/Processing-Websocket-Library">(More)</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>DUL Radio and Event Bus </strong><a href="https://organicityeu.github.io/EventBus/">(More)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>Organicity APIs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://organicityeu.github.io/api/AssetDiscovery.html"><strong>Asset Discovery</strong></a><strong>. </strong>It facilitates exploration and inspection of available assets.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://organicityeu.github.io/api/federation.html">Asset Federation</a>. </strong>It provides access to asset creation and update services of Organicity<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://organicityeu.github.io/api/DataSource.html">Data Source</a> &nbsp;it </strong>provides access to the data stored in Organicity<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://organicityeu.github.io/api/Annotation.html">Asset Annotation</a>. It provides access to asset annotation servives of Organicity.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://organicityeu.github.io/api/Permissions.html">Permissions</a>. It provides inspection, editing and updating of access permissions.</strong></li>
