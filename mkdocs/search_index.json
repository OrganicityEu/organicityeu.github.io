            "text": "Welcome to the \nOrganiCity\n GitHub account. This web page will give you a comprehensive view of all the tools and APIs made available within the facility.\n\n\nExperimentation as a Service Facility\n\n\nOrganiCity project has built an Experimentation-as-a-Service (EaaS) framework that supports the co-creation and validation of a large set of smart city services and applications under real conditions in a powerful innovation ecosystem. It provides functionality to both advanced users/developers, as well as more \"casual\" end-users like citizens or even activists, decision makers or politicians (Organicitizens). The idea behind this objective is that any Organicitizen, might develop and deploy its own services (e.g., a website, a web service, a desktop application or a smartphone application) that interact with the platform through the different APIs exposed by Organicity facility.\n\n\nHigh level architecture of the facility\n\n\nAs it can be seen in the following figure, three different tiers can be distinguished within the OC facility architecture:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n OrganiCity facility high level architecture\n\n\n\n\nOC Experimentation tier\n The OrganiCity Experimentation tier consists of various components (deployed services and applications, template applications or libraries) that facilitate the building of applications and services for experimentation with them. At this level, any Organicitizen with the experimenter role might develop and deploy its own services (e.g., a website, a web service, a desktop application or a smartphone application) that interact with the platform through the different APIs.\n\n\nOC Platform tier\n It is represented by the OC platform and its components that permits platform managers to adminstrate and control it. It exposed different services that can be used by the experimenters to interact with the platform exploring data assets, annotating them or even creating new ones within the scope of their experiment.\n\n\nOC Site tier\n It consists of infrastructures belonging to different \nOC City sites\n, the infrastructures and resources of experimenters \n(OC experimenters site)\n and the infrastructure supporting the generation of crowdsourcing data into the platform \n(OC Provider Site).\n\n    It is important to note that experimenters aiming to feed data into the platform should rely on the OC experimenters site. It exposes several methods trough the Federation API that can create, delete or update assets within the facility under the scope of the experiment \n(More info)\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsers Accounts and registration\n\n\nTo ensure that all interactions with the facility are authenticated with valid user credentials and access rights, Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) mechanisms have been implemented. Users will be enforced to use their own credentials to interact with the different APIs and tools. To start experimenting on top of the OC facility, the experimenters are encouraged to register themselves in the platform. Click \nhere\n to register yourself.\n\nOnce experimenters get registered within the platform, they will be assigned with the OC user role. The OC facility managers will assign the experimenters the OC experimenter role upon the acceptation of the corresponding request. To this end, you should send an email to \nhelpdesk@organicity.eu\n, indicating the mail that you have been registered with and the experiment that you belong to.\n\n\nTools and enablers for experimentation in Organicity\n\n\nOnce the experimenters are registered in the facility, they will have access to a set of tools that will facilitate the experimentation and co-creation activities that they have planned within their experiment. Attending to their functionalities, they can be classified in three different types:\n\n\nTools to Manage the experiment life-cycle\n\n\nTo create, configure and run experiments within the OrganiCity facility, experimenters must use the Experimenter Portal, and other complementary components which will allow them to manage different experiments concurrently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimenter Portal\n It is the user interface to be used by the experimenters in order to define the scope of the experiments and manage them during their entire life cycle. From this portal, the experimenters will get access to the set of co-creation tools offered that they can use to build their experiments, the documentation and support channels. (\nSee further details about how to manage the experiment life cycle\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmartphone experimentation framework\n It is a complementary framework that facilitates experimenter to gather and process data from the sensors and communication interfaces of the smartphones of volunteers and use them to run experiments. \n(More)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Management\n Basic functionality for interacting with the different communities of \nOrganicitizens\n participating in each experiment, which has been integrated within the Experimenter Portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools for discovering, exploring and annotating data assets.\n\n\n\n\nUrban Data Observatory UI\n The UDO provides a UI that allows experimeters to develop a deeper understanding of the federated city data sources that can be used in your experiments. It is based on an Asset Directory that maintains entries for the federated urban assets registered at the facility from the city sites and also from the experiments. \nMore info\n\n\nData Annotation services\n These services simplify the process of creating meaningful knowledge from urban data streams. The first phase of this tool will allow experimenters and citizens to use pre-defined tag sets for annotating existing data assets. (\nMore details\n )\n\n\n\n\nCo-creation tools\n\n\nA set of innovative tools and enablers for the co-creation of urban infrastructure, knowledge and services has been developed and integrated within the EaaS facility infrastructure, extending it and facilitating experimental research for new services and innovative applications.\n\n\n\n\nSensiNact\n aims at helping coders working with data streams from deployed data assets without the need to learn about the Organicity APIs. By using \nit, experimenters can interact with information of different data assets available in\n the different clusters, as well as within the scope of their experiments, and understand the data streams that they provide.

As depicted in the following diagram, the underlying data model of NGSI\n9/10 consists of Asset Element, Asset Attributes and Attribute Metadata\n\n\n\n\nAn asset is associated with multiple attributes and each attribute can be associated with various\nmetadata. Each one of the Organicity Sites and probably Organicity Experiments are contributing assets into\nthe facility. Assets can represent various types of urban resources from\nIoT/sensor devices with sensors attached, smartphones, services, data sources stored as data\nfiles (csv, xml, pdf) shared online or references to data\u00adendpoints online (third party APIs and\ndata services). For purposes of clarity of how the data of the various assets can be accessed the\nOrganicity indexed assets can be organized in three major categories:\n\n\n\n\nOC raw assets\n: for this type of assets clients of OC platform can retrieve either their last\nvalue or historic values. In general it is possible to post various queries for retrieving data\nof the assets. The execution of the queries is managed by the OC facility and the OC\nSite where this asset belongs to.\n\n\nOC dataset assets\n: \u200b these assets are representing data sources encoded in datafiles\nthat are shared online (e.g., CKAN instances where the data sources are exposed as\nfiles csv, xml, xls, pdf etc.). Organicity clients can discover these assets by posting discovery\nqueries on the OC platform based on their various metadata. The  platform just\ndelivers description of the assets. Organicity clients have to access the online urls to fetch the\nfiles and then further process the dataset files to consume the data.\n\n\nOC online data\u00adendpoint assets\n: \u200b these assets are representing  online\ndata\u00adendpoints/APIs for which the actual data access is not managed by the OC facility.\nOC clients can discover these assets by posting discovery queries on OC platform based\non their various metadata. The Organicity platform just delivers description of the assets. OC\nclients have to access the online endpoints in order to post queries and consume the\ndata.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to avoid conflicts with the identification of the assets and facilitating interaction with the\nentity information to the experimenters, there are specific conventions that should be followed on\nAsset, Attribute and Metadata definition.\n\n\nAsset Attributes and Metadata:\n\n\nEach Asset Element has to be associated with a set of of attributes.

The Organicity\nplatform will expose the data annotation service through the Annotation API.\n\n\nSince the UDO is creating a new type of urban data repository and provides a starting point for exploration of\nurban data across different city environments, it is crucial to stimulate extraction and generation of knowledge from the\nraw data streams. Aiming at enhancing the urban data sources with useful information, OrganiCity has developed this service for\nenabling collaborative data annotation. The utilized data model and annotation services are flexible enough to enable various types\nof labels from online resources on the Web, social media and references to rich multimedia content online (images, video, etc.)\n to free-text labels or numeric values. A set of methods has been created for maintaining dynamic label\n categories, labels and labelling of data.\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring labels for a specific set of data sources can be parameterized under the scope of an experiment. Experimenters can define a set\nof label categories to be used by the applications associated with their experiment. Moreover, experimenters, or other end-users,\ncan retrieve the various labels and the corresponding data under the scope of an experiment.  Finally, they can create customized applications\nto acquire annotations from participants, or applications to visualize them.\n\n\nAlong with the crowdsourcing annotation process, experimenters can utilize machine learning algorithms that enable more autonomous\nlearning, semi-supervised learning or reinforcement learning techniques, exploiting the acquired annotations as training sets.\nIt is possible in this way to use the created models as classifiers for automatic labelling of urban resources, events or anomaly detection.\nFurthermore, as users are constantly contributing with annotations, experimenters are possible to perform verification, cross-validation\non the extracted models and create adaptive models using reinforcement learning methodologies.\n\n\nReferences to the specification of the Asset Annotation Service\n- Annotation Service Endpoint: http://annotations.organicity.eu/\n- Annotation Service Swagger UI: http://annotations.organicity.eu/swagger-ui.html\n\n\nData Model\n\n\nThe underlying data model of the annotation service is depicted in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nService Entities\n represent utility/urban services or in general urban processes. An example of a service might be Garbage Collection, Noise Monitoring etc. The basic usage of\nservice entities is the organization and discovery of tag collections (e.g. what tags are usually used for characterizing the noise level sensors etc.)\n\n\nTagDomains Entities\n represent collections of tags. Usually a tag domain is associated with a service and experiment/application specify which tag domains they will use.\n\n\nTag Entities\n represent the actual labels to be used by end-user using an annotation client (application or experiment)\n\n\nApplication Entities\n (a.k.a. experiments) represent the client applications used by end-users during the annotation process.\n\n\nAsset Entities\n are the assets of Urban data observatory that are annotated (associated by user with an existing tag/label)\n\n\n\n\nThere are some underlying restriction and rules to Organicity users on accessing and using the annotation service. For the following Organicity roles:\nUser Roles:\n- OC Admin (OC-A):\n    - can create, read, update and delete (CRUD) Service, TagDomain, Tag, Application and Annotatation entities\n- OC Experimenter (OC-E):\n    - can only Read Service, TagDomain, Tag entities that are public\n    - CRUD the ones involved in their experiment\n    - OC-E can CRUD all annotations of his applications\n- OC Participant (OC-P):\n    - can only Read Service, TagDomain, Tag entities that are public\n    - OC-P can CRUD only his annotations\n- OC Anonymous (OC-AN)\n    - OC-AN can R only COUNT aggregations of annotations\n\n\nEntity Description\n\n\nThe objects of the entities are comply with the following schema:\n\n\nTag\n\n\n{\n    \nid\n: 0,\n    \nname\n: \nstring\n,\n    \nurn\n:

            "text": "Data Annotation Service manages the data annotation process on assets of all Organicity sites.\nThe primary goal of this service is to provide to the programmable clients an available set of\ntag domains and then receive and store tags (tag attachment on an asset by a user). The Organicity\nplatform will expose the data annotation service through the Annotation API.  Since the UDO is creating a new type of urban data repository and provides a starting point for exploration of\nurban data across different city environments, it is crucial to stimulate extraction and generation of knowledge from the\nraw data streams. Aiming at enhancing the urban data sources with useful information, OrganiCity has developed this service for\nenabling collaborative data annotation. The utilized data model and annotation services are flexible enough to enable various types\nof labels from online resources on the Web, social media and references to rich multimedia content online (images, video, etc.)\n to free-text labels or numeric values. A set of methods has been created for maintaining dynamic label\n categories, labels and labelling of data.   Acquiring labels for a specific set of data sources can be parameterized under the scope of an experiment. Experimenters can define a set\nof label categories to be used by the applications associated with their experiment. Moreover, experimenters, or other end-users,\ncan retrieve the various labels and the corresponding data under the scope of an experiment.  Finally, they can create customized applications\nto acquire annotations from participants, or applications to visualize them.  Along with the crowdsourcing annotation process, experimenters can utilize machine learning algorithms that enable more autonomous\nlearning, semi-supervised learning or reinforcement learning techniques, exploiting the acquired annotations as training sets.\nIt is possible in this way to use the created models as classifiers for automatic labelling of urban resources, events or anomaly detection.\nFurthermore, as users are constantly contributing with annotations, experimenters are possible to perform verification, cross-validation\non the extracted models and create adaptive models using reinforcement learning methodologies.

An example of a service might be Garbage Collection, Noise Monitoring etc. The basic usage of\nservice entities is the organization and discovery of tag collections (e.g. what tags are usually used for characterizing the noise level sensors etc.)  TagDomains Entities  represent collections of tags. Usually a tag domain is associated with a service and experiment/application specify which tag domains they will use.  Tag Entities  represent the actual labels to be used by end-user using an annotation client (application or experiment)  Application Entities  (a.k.a. experiments) represent the client applications used by end-users during the annotation process.  Asset Entities  are the assets of Urban data observatory that are annotated (associated by user with an existing tag/label)   There are some underlying restriction and rules to Organicity users on accessing and using the annotation service.

            "text": "Experimenter Portal\n\n\nThe Experimenter Portal (EP) provides a common interface for the experimenters to carry out several management task such as creation and modification of experiments, control of developments (i.e. applications, tools) carried out under such experiments, and monitoring the results obtained from them. In this sense, the EP enables to manage the whole lifecycle of the experiments and facilitates the interaction with other related OrganiCity functionalities. In the following we will thoroughly describe the EP by showcasing the interactions of the experimenter with the tool.\n\n\nEntering the portal\n\n\nEP can be accessed through the URL http://experimenters.organicity.eu . After a successful login, the experimenter is redirected to the main page of the EP, shown in Figure 1. As can be observed, the portal provides rapid access to the different development alternatives facilitated by OrganiCity in the sidebar: links to co-creation tools, to develop new services and applications; access to documentation of tools and APIs, necessary for the experiment development; and finally, provide links to support tools, such as OrganiCity FAQ system, GitHub repository and dedicated google groups channel, devoted to provide timely support to the experimenters.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the main view, it is also shown the list of current experiments indicating whether or not they are ongoing, so that the experimenter can see, at a glance, its experimentation state. As can be seen, the portal provides the option to remove experiments as well as to create new ones. When you remove an experiment, all the information related to the experiment will be lost. This will also disable the applications developed under the experiment.\n\n\nCreating new experiment\n\n\nIn order to create a new experiment, the portal will request general information about the experiment such as its name and description (Figure 2). It is recommended to use a catchy name and a detailed description in order to encourage people to take part on it. The experimenter also defines the time during which the experiment will be available. After that period of time the experiment cannot be used by participants, but still exist in the EP. Besides, for each experiment, it is defined the assets, or information sources, it can handle. Such assets could be public, this means that assets created by this experiment will be visible for everyone, otherwise only this experiment, and their applications, will be allowed to use them.\n\n\nFigure 2:\n\n\n\n\nAfter providing basic information about the new experiment, the portal will request define the experiment area (Figure 3), which consisting of a set of regions where the experiment will take place. This area will be used as a first filter to select, by using some UDO functionalities, the assets used along the experiment.

Firstly, the information provided during the experiment creation process is displayed, as shown in Figure 4, allowing the portal user modify it. By this way, an experimenter might modify the experiment settings during its lifecycle: extending or limiting the area of the experiment, modifying its timespan or editing the experiment tags to better indicate its aim.\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\nCreating new assets\n\n\nIn the most of cases, the experiment will include the development of some kind of application (e.g. mobile application) that will enable to participant interact with the experiment. These applications will produce information whose structure should be previously defined by the experimenter. For this end, the portal enables to create new assets by means of an editor (see Figure 5) with a twofold purpose: first to simplify the definition of new information sources by a visual tool, and secondly to provide a template and useful insight to create assets via software. As can be observed in Figure 5, during the asset edition, the experimenter will see the resulting output (JSON format) and how some of the fields are autocompleted with experiment specific information (e.g. experiment and experimenter identifiers).\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\n\n\nManaging experiment applications\n\n\nExperimenter Portal also provides the functionality to manage applications. The detailed information of the applications, such as links to download them, can be edited during the whole experiment lifecycle and will be advertised to the OrganiCity participants so as to facilitate their use. As the application is constrained to the characteristics of the experiment, the application scope is also limited by spatio-temporal dimension of the experiment, as well as by the assets that the application can use.",

Figure 1:    In the main view, it is also shown the list of current experiments indicating whether or not they are ongoing, so that the experimenter can see, at a glance, its experimentation state.

The experimenter also defines the time during which the experiment will be available. After that period of time the experiment cannot be used by participants, but still exist in the EP. Besides, for each experiment, it is defined the assets, or information sources, it can handle. Such assets could be public, this means that assets created by this experiment will be visible for everyone, otherwise only this experiment, and their applications, will be allowed to use them.  Figure 2:   After providing basic information about the new experiment, the portal will request define the experiment area (Figure 3), which consisting of a set of regions where the experiment will take place. This area will be used as a first filter to select, by using some UDO functionalities, the assets used along the experiment.

The majority of London\u2019s 33 boroughs supply measurements to the network and in addition these data are increasingly being supplemented by measurements from local authorities surrounding London, thereby providing an overall perspective of air pollution in London. The LAQN is operated and managed by the Environmental Research Group (ERG) at King\u2019s College London. QA/QC audits are carried out by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL).\n\n\nBased on the 2014 \nLAQN report\n, the air quality observations made are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3), Particles (PM10) and Particles (PM2.5) along with environmental observations like Wind Speed, Temperature, Rainfall, etc. in over 60 monitoring sites.\n\n\n{\n

Based on the 2014  LAQN report , the air quality observations made are Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3), Particles (PM10) and Particles (PM2.5) along with environmental observations like Wind Speed, Temperature, Rainfall, etc. in over 60 monitoring sites.  {\n     id :  urn:oc:entity:london:aqn:CD9 ,\n     type :  urn:oc:entityType:iotdevice ,\n     location : {\n         type :  geo:point ,\n         value :  -0.129053205282516,51.5277066194645 ,\n         metadata : {}\n    },\n     origin : {\n         type :  urn:oc:attributeType:origin ,\n         value :  http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/API/ ,\n         metadata : {\n             unit : {\n                 type :  NOT_APPLIED ,\n                 value :  NOT_APPLIED \n            }\n        }\n    },\n     datasource : {\n         type :  urn:oc:attributeType:datasource ,\n         value :  http://london.site.organicity.eu:8081/api/v1/entities/ ,\n         metadata : {\n             datasourceInternal : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:datatype:boolean ,\n                 value :  true \n            }\n        }\n    },\n     description : {\n         type :  urn:oc:attributeType:description ,\n         value :  CD9 ,\n         metadata : {}\n    },\n     chemicalAgentAtmosphericConcentration:NO : {\n         type :  urn:oc:attributeType:chemicalAgentAtmosphericConcentration:NO ,\n         value :  46.2 ,\n         metadata : {\n             unit : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:uom:microgramPerCubicMetre ,\n                 value :  microgramPerCubicMetre \n            },\n             datatype : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:datatype:numeric ,\n                 value :  numeric \n            }\n        }\n    },\n     chemicalAgentAtmosphericConcentration:airParticlesPM10 : {\n         type :  urn:oc:attributeType:chemicalAgentAtmosphericConcentration:airParticlesPM10 ,\n         value :  25.8 ,\n         metadata : {\n             unit : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:uom:miligramPerCubicMetre ,\n                 value :  miligramPerCubicMetre \n            },\n             datatype : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:datatype:numeric ,\n                 value :  numeric \n            }\n        }\n    },\n     chemicalAgentAtmosphericConcentration:airParticlesPM25 : {\n         type :  urn:oc:attributeType:chemicalAgentAtmosphericConcentration:airParticlesPM25 ,\n         value :  17.5 ,\n         metadata : {\n             unit : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:uom:miligramPerCubicMetre ,\n                 value :  miligramPerCubicMetre \n            },\n             datatype : {\n                 type :  urn:oc:datatype:numeric ,\n                 value :  numeric \n            }\n        }\n    }\n}",

Of course, a unified experience requires all Organicity components to properly talk to Organicity Accounts. This document guides through the process of setting your component up.\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nScopes\n\n\nRefresh_token\n\n\n\n\nOAuth2 Grants\n\n\nOrganicity Accounts\n is an \nOAuth2 server\n, which provides a Single Sign-On (SSO) service. Thus, you can login to\nall Organicity Components by using one single account. In case of web-applications, you even just need to login once.\nProbably you know this from Google: To use gmail, youtube or the calendar, you use the same account.\n\n\n\n\n\nClient ID + Client Secret\n\n\nAfter creating your experiment within the \nExperimenter Portal\n, you will receive a \nclient_id\n and a \nclient_secret\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nclient_id\n is public, so it can be added to the source code, which is uses it to build a login URL finally.\n\n\nThe \nclient_secret\n is private and must be kept confidential!\n\n\n\n\nGrant Types\n\n\nThe OAuth2 specification\n provides several \nGrant Types\n for different types of applications:\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Code Grant\n: Used for web-applications with a server-side component, which can keep the \nclient_id\n confidential.\n\n\nImplicit Grant\n: Used for browser-based applications (e.g., JavaScript-only applications without a server-side component) or mobile apps.\n\n\n\n\nIn this two grants, after a successful login, the applications will act \nin name of the user\n. There is one more important grant:\n\n\n\n\nClient Credential Grant\n: Only used for application, which \nact on their own\n.\n\n\n\n\nPer default, this grant ist not enabled for experiments.\n\n\nEndpoints\n\n\nThe following endpointd are needed by the grants described below:\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Endpoint\n: https://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/auth\n\n\nToken Endpoint\n: https://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/token\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization Code Grant\n\n\nAs said before, this grant is used for applications running on a web server. Thus, the source code of the web-application\nkeeps the \nclient_secret\n confidential. This grant is divided in two flows:\n\n\nFor the \nfirst flow\n, you must extend the authorization endpoint with the following\nquery parameters:\n\n\n\n\nclient_id=\nCLIENT_ID\n: Here, you must include your \nclient_id\n, which is provided by the Experimenter Portal\n\n\nresponse_type=code\n: Here, the response type must be \ncode\n\n\nredirect_uri=\nREDIRECT_URI\n: Within the Experimenter Portal, you can configure Redirect URIs. After a successful login, the user is redirected to that URI.\n\n\n\n\nHINT\n: Make sure, that you're web-application, and thus the \nredirect_uri\n, runs on HTTPS. This ensures, that the exchanged data cannot be intercepted during the login process.\n\n\nThus, the full authorization URL looks as follows:\n\n\nhttps://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=\nCLIENT_ID\nresponse_type=code\nredirect_uri=\nREDIRECT_URI\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\nhttps://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=example\nresponse_type=code\nredirect_uri=https://example.com/callback\n\n\n\n\nCalling this URL, the users must login with their credentials. If the login is successful, the user is redirected back to the configured redirect URI.\nOAuth2 appends one parameter to the URL:\n\n\n\n\ncode\n: This is the so called \nauthorization_code\n, which is needed in the next step.\n\n\n\n\nThus, the full callback URL looks as follows:\n\n\nREDIRECT_URI\n?code=\nCODE\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\nhttps://example.com/callback?code=0123456789\n\n\n\n\nNow, the \nsecond flow\n starts. You're web-application takes this \ncode\n and must send an HTTP POST request to the\n\ntoken endpoint\n, with the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nclient_id=\nCLIENT_ID\n: Here, you must include your \nclient_id\n, which is provided by the Experimenter Portal\n\n\ngrant_type=authorization_code\n: The \ngrant_type\n must be \nauthorization_code\n. Here you see, where the name comes from.\n\n\nredirect_uri=\nREDIRECT_URI\n: The same URI as before\n\n\ncode=\nCODE\n: The code from the callback URL\n\n\nclient_secret=\nCLIENT_SECRET\n: Here, you must include your \nclient_secret\n, which is provided by the Experimenter Portal\n\n\n\n\nHINT\n: Make sure, that this call is done from the web-application in the background, thus the \nclient_secret\n stays confidential!\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nCalling this URL, the server verifies your credentials and the code. If successful, the server returns a JSON, which contains the following attributes:\n\n\n\n\ntoken_type\n: This is usually \nBearer\n\n\naccess_token\n: this is the \nAccess Token\n in JSON\n\n\nexpires_in\n: a number in seconds, how long the Access Token is valid\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\n{\n    \naccess_token\n: \nACCESS_TOKEN\n,\n    \ntoken_type\n: \nbearer\n,\n    \nexpires_in\n: 300,\n}\n\n\n\n\nSee here for further details on the Access Tokens\n.\n\n\nImplicit Grant\n\n\nHINT\n:\n\n\nThis grant is used for browser-based applications (e.g., JavaScript-only applications without a server-side component) or mobile apps.\nThese kind of applications cannot keep the \nclient_secret\n confidential. The Implicit Grant has just one flow, which returns\nthe Access Token directly. The Grant is called \nimplicit\n, as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) are issued.\n\n\nFor this grant, you must extend the authorization endpoint with the following query parameters:\n\n\n\n\nclient_id=\nCLIENT_ID\n: Here, you must include your \nclient_id\n, which is provided by the Experimenter Portal\n\n\nresponse_type=token\n: Here, the response type must be \ntoken\n (becaue you'll get an Access Token immediately)\n\n\nredirect_uri=\nREDIRECT_URI\n: Within the Experimenter Portal, you can configure Redirect URIs. After a successful login, the user is redirected to that URI.\n\n\n\n\nHINT\n: Make sure, that you're web-application, and thus the \nredirect_uri\n, runs on HTTPS. This ensures, that the exchanged data cannot be intercepted during the login process.\n\n\nThus, the full authorization URL looks as follows:\n\n\nhttps://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=\nCLIENT_ID\nresponse_type=token\nredirect_uri=\nREDIRECT_URI\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\nhttps://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=example\nresponse_type=token\nredirect_uri=https://example.com/callback\n\n\n\n\nCalling this URL, the users must login with their credentials. If the login is successful, the user is redirected back to the configured redirect URI.\nOAuth2 appends one parameter to the URL:\n\n\n\n\ntoken\n: This is the Access Token in JSON\n\n\n\n\nThe JSON contains the following attributes (similar to the \nAuthorization Code Flow\n):\n\n\n\n\ntoken_type\n: This is usually \nBearer\n\n\naccess_token\n: this is the \nAccess Token\n itself\n\n\nexpires_in\n: a number in seconds, how long the Access Token is valid\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\n{\n    \naccess_token\n: \nACCESS_TOKEN\n,\n    \ntoken_type\n: \nbearer\n,\n    \nexpires_in\n: 300,\n}\n\n\n\n\nSee here for further details on the Access Tokens\n.\n\n\nClient Credential Grant\n\n\nHINT:\n Per default, this grant ist not enabled for experiments.\n\n\nThe \nClient Credential Grant\n is used for applications, which \nact on their own\n. For this, the \nService Account\n of the Client must be enabled.\n\n\nService Accounts usually apply for Organicity Accounts, but can also be used by e.g. experiments. To use a Service Account, you perform a simple HTTPS with your \nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n call, which will return a suitable Access Token:\n\n\nPOST /realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: accounts.organicity.eu\nAuthorization: Basic \nBASE64_ENCODE(client_id:client_secret)\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=client_credentials\n\n\n\n\nThe Authorization header contains your \nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n encoded with HTTP basic authentication. For details on how to create this field, \nsee here\n.\n\n\nThe call returns a JSON record, which contains the following attributes:\n\n\n\n\ntoken_type\n: This is usually \nBearer\n\n\naccess_token\n: this is the \nAccess Token\n itself\n\n\nexpires_in\n: a number in seconds, how long the Access Token is valid\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\n{\n    \naccess_token\n: \nACCESS_TOKEN\n,\n    \ntoken_type\n: \nbearer\n,\n    \nexpires_in\n: 300,\n}\n\n\n\n\nSee here for further details on the Access Tokens\n.\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\nOf course, you do not have to write you're own OAuth2 adapter. You can use well-tested existing librabries, like the following:\n\n\n\n\nNode.js with Passport: \npassport-oauth2\n\n\nPHP: \noauth2-client\n\n\n\n\nFor these two, we created two minimal working examples:\n\n\n\n\nNode.js with Passport:  \naccounts-demo-passport\n\n\nPHP: \naccounts-demo-php\n\n\n\n\nIn order to talk to Organicity Accounts, your component needs to talk to the Accounts Server using any of the above mentioned grants.\n\n\nSources on OAuth2\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2\n\n\nhttps://alexbilbie.com/guide-to-oauth-2-grants/\n\n\nhttps://aaronparecki.com/2012/07/29/2/oauth2-simplified",

This architecture can be seen below:\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Asset-Subscription-Proxy\n\n\nTo push assets to the Organicity Central Orion, please clone the repository of the Asset-Subscription-Proxy\n and configure it:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/OrganicityEu-Platform/Asset-Subscription-Proxy.git\ncd Asset-Subscription-Proxy\ncp config.js.example config.js\n\n\n\n\nNext, install the Dependencies:\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the Asset-Subscription-Proxy\n\n\nEdit the \nconfig.js\n by applying your \nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n.\n\n\nFor the \nDev-Server\n, make sure the following configuration is used:\n\n\nconfig.asset_directory_host = 'dev.orion.organicity.eu';\nconfig.asset_directory_port = '443';\nconfig.asset_directory_protocol = 'https'\n\n\n\n\nFor the \nProduction Server\n, make sure the following configuration is used:\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards, you can start the proxy:\n\n\nnode server\n\n\n\n\nAdd Subscription to your local Orion\n\n\nEdit the \nconfig.js\n by applying your Orion configuration.

If this is wrong (e.g., Orion and Asset-Subscription-Proxy run on different machines), please modify the \nconfig.subscription_url\n.\n\n\nAfterwards, you can initiate the subscription:\n\n\nnode subscribe\n\n\n\n\nIf it was successful, you wll get the Subscription of your Orion:\n\n\nSuccessful: /v2/subscriptions/57ea49394735cf79905858c0\n\n\n\n\nHint\n: Run this only once. Otherwise, you have multiple subscriptions!\n\n\nVerify subscription at your local Orion\n\n\nNow you can verify your subscription:\n\n\nGET http://localhost:1026/v2/subscriptions/57ea49394735cf79905858c0\nAccept: application/json\nFiware-Service: organicity\n\n\n\n\nPush an Asset to your local Orion\n\n\nNext step is to test the federation.

This will be assigned to your experiment by the Organicity team.\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication in Organicity is activity-centere: Users acquire \nAccess Tokens\n to perform an action with them in the next minutes. Access Tokens invalidate after 5 minutes, and have to be renewed with Refresh Tokens.\n\n\nWhile this is good for security, it is unusable for long-term applications that run without supervision, like environmentally deployed sensor nodes.\nAs these nodes still need to contact Organicity, for example to post measured data, they need a way to authenticate. This is facilitated by Refresh Tokens.\n\n\nPlease note\n: In order to generate Offline Tokens, a user needs to have the required role \noffline_access\n. Usually, every user gets this role when they sign up.\n\n\nAcquire Refresh Tokens\n\n\nTo acquire Refresh Tokens, you just need to append the additional query parameter \nscope=offline_access\n to your Authorization Endpoint.\n\n\nAuthorization Code Grant\n\n\nThe flow is the same as \ndescribed here\n, just with the additional query parameter \nscope=offline_access\n.\n\n\nThe full authorization URL looks as follows:\n\n\nhttps://accounts.organicity.eu/realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=\nCLIENT_ID\nresponse_type=code\nredirect_uri=\nREDIRECT_URI\nscope=offline_access\n\n\n\n\nAs in the regular grant, it returns an \nAuthorization Code\n which must be converted into an Access Token.\n\n\nIf successful, the server returns a JSON, which contains the following attributes:\n\n\n\n\ntoken_type\n: This is usually \nBearer\n\n\naccess_token\n: this is the \nAccess Token\n in JSON\n\n\nexpires_in\n: a number in seconds, how long the Access Token is valid\n\n\nrefresh_token\n: this is the \nRefresh Token\n\n\ntyp\n: The type is \u00e0lways \nOffline\n\n\nrefresh_expires_in\n: this is usually \n0\n, because the Refresh Token never exipres\n\n\n\n\nAn example:\n\n\n{\n    \naccess_token\n: \nACCESS_TOKEN\n,\n    \ntoken_type\n: \nbearer\n,\n    \nexpires_in\n: 300,\n    \nrefresh_token\n: \nREFRESH_TOKEN\n,\n    \ntyp\n: Offline\n,\n    \nrefresh_expires_in\n: 0\n}\n\n\n\n\nImplicit Grant\n\n\nThis grant cannot return a refresh token, because the application cannot keep the \nclient_secret\n confidential (see below).\n\n\nClient Credential Grant\n\n\nThis grant cannot return a refresh token, because this grant directly returns the Access Token.\n\n\nRefresh Token Grant\n\n\nTo use a the \nRefresh Token Grant\n, you perform a simple HTTPS call, which will return a new suitable Access Token.\n\n\nPOST /realms/organicity/protocol/openid-connect/token HTTP/1.1\nHost: accounts.organicity.eu\nAuthorization: Basic \nBASE64_ENCODE(client_id:client_secret)\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\ngrant_type=refresh_token\nrefresh_token=\nREFRESH_TOKEN\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note, that the same \nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n is needed to refresh the token.\n\n\nThe server verifies your credentials and the refresh token.\nIf successful, the server returns a JSON record as described above.\n\n\nPlease note\n\n\n\n\nRefresh Tokens are valid indefinitely, thus Refresh Tokens will remain valid from call to call, so each renewal can be performed with \nthe same initial Refresh Token\n! This means, there is no reason to store the refresh Token from the response. Thus, Offline-Tokens can be used by embedded devices like IoT devices.\n\n\nThis is normal \nAccess Token\n, which can be used a Bearer Token for all Organicity APIs\n\n\nThe \nAccess Token is valid for 5 Minutes\n, thus a refresh is needed after 5 minutes.\n\n\nAn Access Token needs to be refreshed at least \nevery 30 days\n, as otherwise the Refresh Token will invalidate, and a new Refresh Token needs to be generated.\n\n\n\n\nCode Sample\n\n\nNext we will describe a way, how you get Offline Tokens with the node.js tool \naccounts-demo-passport\n.\n\n\nTo get the initial Refresh Token, please install the tool as described in the README. Change the file \nserver/auth/oauth2.js\n by adding your \nclient_id\n and \nclient_secret\n and run the application. The application runs on port 3000 by default.

            "text": "SensiNact\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nSensiNact aims at helping coders working with data streams from deployed \u201cIoT\u201d devices without the need to complex API configuration.\n\n\nUsing SensiNact, experimenters can find Internet of Things devices which are deployed in the city, and understand the data streams that they provide. The SensiNact IDE allows the creation of applications using a scripting tool (with Code Assist functionality). These applications might set up alerts for when variables in the data streams reach certain levels, or can aggregate data from many devices, creating virtual devices which provide coarse data that might be more useful to an experiment.\n\n\nThe following schema summaries the way SensiNact integrates with the OrganiCity Experimentation as a Service facility.\n\n\n\n\nThe Organicity EaaS facility collects and stores data from the federated sites (Santander, Aarhus and London, on this schema). SensiNact Gateway is connected to this platform, and is notifed when IoT devices is added, removed, or when sensed data is updated. SensiNact studio provides a graphical UI to the gateway. It ease discovering devices, and provides an editor to write applications using IoT devices.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nTo use sensiNact, you need a gateway, and the studio.\n\n\nSensiNact gateway\n will be provided as a service, in the cloud. To get the url and your credentials, please contact \nEtienne Gandrille\n.\n\n\nSensiNact studio\n is based on the well known Eclipse IDE. To recieve a download link, please contact \nEtienne Gandrille\n.\n\n\nStudio\n\n\nSensiNact Studio allows an easy interaction with the OrganiCity  devices and the creation of applications. The Studio is based on the Eclipse platform [Eclipse] and built as a rich client platform application. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed using the views mechanism from Eclipse. Thus, it propose s views for browsing devices, locating devices on a map and interacting with them, i.e., getting value from sensors or performing actions on actuators. The Studio is also targeted to ease the creation of IoT application following the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) pattern [Den89].\n\n\n\n\nThe GUI includes different views: navigator, deployment, properties views, as well as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) editor.\n\n\nBrowsing devices\n\n\nBefore users can use the studio for managing devices and applications, they need to connect a SensiNact gateway (see paragraph 4.3). This action is performed by clicking on the plus sign icon on the device navigator. Then, gateway information have to be provided.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the information have been provided and the dialog validated, the Gateway is added to the Navigator View. To display and browse the available devices imported by this gateway, connecting to it is needed. This action is performed using the connect button.\n\n\n\n\nThe device Navigator View is then populated, and pin points are displayed on the map. By clicking on attributes names, it is possible to get the current value for the considered attribute. It is also possible to see attributes values on the map, clicking on the pin points.\n\n\nApplication management\n\n\nApplication creation\n\n\n\n\nThe SensiNact Studio allows the creation of applications to be executed on the gateway. Creating an application is performed by writing a script using a dedicated syntax, and deploying this script to the gateway.\n\n\nOn the figure above, a project has been created on the project explorer view (on the left). In this project, a script named speed-limit.sna has been created, and is being edited. As the figures shows, the editor provides code highlighting (some keywords are displayed in a special font), code completion (with popups) and a syntax validator which displays red crosses on the script margin in case of error.\n\n\nThe dedicated syntax, a Domain Specific Language, is composed by the following blocks:\n\n\n\n\nThe shortcut block:\n each resource is accessible through a unique URI, which can be quite long. This block aims at creating shortcut for the next blocks.\n\n\nThe event block:\n the developer defines on which resources the application is triggered. When an event is thrown and is a valid trigger, the conditional block is executed.\n\n\nThe conditional block:\n once the application has been triggered, and before any action can be executed, the data from the resource has to satisfy the conditional block. The keyword for this block is if followed by the conditions to be validated.\n\n\nThe actions statements:\n if the conditional block is satisfied, actions are performed in the order that they are listed. The actions can be physical actions on actuators or virtual actions such as changing the format of a data using a mathematical function. The available actions, also named functions, are listed below:\n\n\nBasic functions:\n addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulo, string concatenation, substring, various operators (e.g., equals, greater than, lesser than, different), ACT and SET methods on sensiNact resources.\n\n\nComplex Event Processing functions (using the Esper1 library):\n after, before, coincides, average, average deviation, count, max, min, median, standard deviation and sum.\n\n\n\n\nThe following table shows the basic structure for writing a script.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n[resource \n]+\n\n  \nShortcut block, which must contains at least one statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \non \n+\n\n  \nThe event block, lists the events triggering the script. At least one event must be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n[if \n do]+\n[\n]+\n[else do]?\n[\n]?+\nend if;\n\n  \nThe conditional block, which lists actions to be performed based on conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the script has been written, it can be deployed to the gateway where it will be executed. This is performed using a right click on the script file.\n\n\n\n\nApplication monitoring\n\n\nAfter the application has been deployed, a new set of resources is automatically created under the AppManager device. You can browse those resources into the Device Navigator View.\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, a new service is created with the name of the sna file (without the extension). In our example, it is speed-limit. This service representing the application always contains a standard set of resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nResource\n\n    \nType\n\n    \nDescription\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nautorestart\n\n  \nproperty\n\n  \nIn case of failure, decides if the application should be automatically started again\n\n\n\n\n\n  \ncontent\n\n  \nproperty\n\n  \nScript file content\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nEXCEPTION\n\n  \naction\n\n  \nDeprecated\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nlocation\n\n  \nproperty\n\n  \nGPS location which can be used if it makes sense \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nmaxinstances\n\n  \nproperty\n\n  \nNumber of parallel instances which should be started\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nresetOnStop\n\n  \nproperty\n\n  \nOn Stop, decides if the generated resources by the application should be destroyed or kept\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSTART\n\n  \naction\n\n  \nStarts the application\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nstatus\n\n  \nstate variable\n\n  \nCurrent status of the application: START/STOP/...\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSTOP\n\n  \naction\n\n  \nStops the application\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nUNINSTALL\n\n  \naction\n\n  \nRemoves the application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo start the application, simply double click on the START resource.

The studio can be used to check if the application has the expected behavior, by querying the resources. The studio can also be shutted down, since the applications are executed on the gateway, which will be presented in paragraph 4.3 (sensiNact Gateway). \n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIn this section, we have presented the way sensiNact Studio can gives an overview of the available devices in the OrganiCity  context. We have also shown the creation process of IoT application following the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) pattern.\n\n\nGateway\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThe sensiNact Gateway allows the interconnection of heterogeneous devices and services into a consistent model. This one is presented to the sensiNact Studio which can monitor the devices ecosystem and design application to be executed on the gateway.\n\n\n\n\nMore precisely, the sensiNact Gateway integrates with the OC Platform using the Asset Discovery Service. Thereby, the gateway is aware of the assets provided by the OC Platform. On the other hand, the gateway has dedicated interfaces to directly connect to third parties devices and API. As a result, the gateway can interact with a lot of resources, which can be local or remote.\n\n\nThe gateway architecture\n\n\nThe interactions between the gateway and other entities are performed through a set of northbound and southbound bridges. The goal of the bridges is to manage the communication with devices and services, which can be local or remote. On one hand, southbound bridges are in charge of collecting data from sensors and services, and to send orders which will be performed by actuators. On the other hand, northbound bridges are specialized in interacting with remote systems. Thanks to those bridges, it is possible to make third party systems aware of devices \n virtual resources known by the gateway.\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of connectivity, on the southbound side the sensiNact gateway allows to cope both with \u201cphysical device\u201d protocols and \u201cvirtual device\u201d ones, allowing a uniform and transparent access to an XBee network, or an HTTP Restful web service for example. Here's a non-exhaustive list of supported protocols:\n\n\n\n  \n**EnOcean [EnOcean],** energy harvesting wireless sensor technology (ultra-low-power radio technology for free wireless sensors), and protocols in use to interact with those sensors;\n\n  \n**Bluetooth Low Energy.** Part of the Bluetooth specification version 4 [Bluetooth4], it is a personal area network, low power protocol designed mainly for healthcare or entertainment type of applications;\n\n  \n**MQTT [MQTT],** which is a machine-to-machine protocol, lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport, useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium;\n\n  \n**ZigBee [ZigBee]** based protocols (XBee for example);\n\n  \n**CoAP [RFC7252],** which is a REST application protocol, designed to be \u201cthe HTTP for constrained networks and devices\u201d whose concept originated from the idea that \"the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,\" and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things; it is usually used on top of a 6LoWPAN network, but it may travel regular IP networks as well (it is used by the OMA LWM2M protocol, for instance).\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the northbound side the sensiNact gateway provides both client/server and publish/subscribe access protocols: MQTT [MQTT], JSON-RPC (1.0 and 2.0) [JSON-RPC], HTTP RESTful, CDMI [CDMI].\n\n\nAll the communications of sensiNact gateway are converging to a central piece: the core. This element is in charge of the overall coordination of information, involving two managers: the device manager and the application manager.\n\n\nThe device manager, with its associated database (the OSGi registry) stores all the information regarding devices. This include devices availability, and also devices properties, location, etc.\n\n\nThe application manager is a bit more complex. It manages the applications, following devices availability and updating applications life cycle. It offers a plug-in facility, to extend its behaviour. The two main plugins are the Event Condition Action plugin, and the Complex Event Processor plugin. The Event Condition Action plugin provides the basic structure for creating applications. It allows the triggering of rules, based on event. Then, a condition can be evaluated, and actions performed accordingly. Of course, events, conditions and actions are related to devices, using the device manager. Using the Esper Engine, the Complex Event Processor plugin is able to generate high level events based on low level ones. For example, it is possible to know that two events occur in a given time interval, with a given order. The events generated by the CEP plug-in can be used in the ECA plugin.\n\n\nSensiNact resource model\n\n\n\nIt is important to understand the internal model of the sensiNact Gateway , since it is used everywhere in the sensiNact ecosystem. That is why, a clear understanding of the concepts and relationships between them can even help using the Studio introduced previously.\n\n\nAll the devices and their related informations are represented using a standard resource model. It is structured around three main concepts: Service Provider, Service and Resource. A Service Provider repr\u00e9sents an entity, which can be a device or something more abstract such as an API endpoint. This Service Provider can have several Services, which are a meaningful aggregate of resources based on a common purpose. A resource is the place where information is stored. For example, on a weather station, a temperature sensor will be a resource providing the temperature.\n\n\n\n\nBased on its purpose, a resource can be a Property, a Sensor Data, a State Variable, or an Action. The differences among them is detailed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nType\n\n    \nDescription\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nProperty\n\n  \nProperty exposed by a service. This is information which is likely to be static (owner, model, vendor, static location, etc.). In some cases, this property can be allowed to be modified.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSensor Data\n\n  \nSensory data provided by a service. This is real-time information provided, for example, by the SmartObject that measures physical quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nState Variable\n\n  \nInformation representing a SmartObject state variable of the service. This variable is most likely to be modified by an action (turn on light modifies the light state, opening door changes the door state, etc.) but also to intrinsic conditions associated to the working procedure of the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nAction\n\n  \nFunctionality provided by a service. This is mostly an actuation on the physical environment via an actuator SmartObject supporting this functionality (turn on light, open door, etc.) but can also be a request to do a virtual action (play a multimedia on a TV, make a parking space reservation, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it is not possible to directly interact with resources, sensiNact provides access methods. The access methods that can be associated to a resource depend on the resource type, for example, a GET method can only be associated to resources of type Property, State Variable and SensorData. A SET method can only be associated to State Variable and modifiable Property resources. An ACT method can only be associated to an Action resource. SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE methods can be associated to any resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nType\n\n    \nDescription\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \nGET\n\n  \nGets the value attribute of the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSET\n\n  \nSets a given new value as the data value of the resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nACT\n\n  \nInvokes the resource (method execution) with a set of defined parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nSUBSCRIBE\n\n  \nSubscribes to the resource with optional condition and periodicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nUNSUBSCRIBE\n\n  \nRemove an existing subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWe have presented the architecture of the sensiNact Gateway, and the way it is integrated into the OC Platform. We also have introduced its resource model, since it is used in the studio as well.\n\n\nTo help experimenters start easily using the Studio, we are providing \u201cGateways as a Service\u201d for the OrganiCity project. They are Gateways available in the cloud, and configured for interacting with OrganiCity devices.",

            "text": "These are the TSmarT devices. A tool for retrieving environment data and establish alarms in your experiments within the  OrganiCity  EaaS platform.  This tool is based on the widespread TSmarT platform and its goal is to take advantage of sensor integration capabilities to provide not only a source of data but also a point to be handled remotely.  TSmarT devices are integrated with OrganiCity platform and therefore able to share data retrieved by their sensors with experimenters and users, who can check those values through the OrganiCity  Observatory . On a first stage, up to 15 TSmarT devices will be available for experimenters through OrganiCity platform. They will be initially located in different spots in Spain, with the majority of them sending data from Santander, but also from Madrid and Barcelona.  OrganiCity TSmart devices act as a source of data, providing information related to environmental conditions thanks to the sensors integrated in them. Experimenters will be able to check periodically temperature, humidity and illuminance values wherever the devices are located, as well as establish simple alarms that could help them when creating their applications.",
